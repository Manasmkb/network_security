# Network Security Home Lab

This repository is my **Network Security Home Lab**, documenting hands-on exercises where I secure an Ubuntu server and explore its network environment.  

Each lab is a **chapter**, focusing on specific tools, commands, and techniques for analyzing and strengthening system security.  

The purpose of this repo is:
- To practice **network security fundamentals** on Ubuntu servers.
- To demonstrate **hands-on technical skills** with industry tools (Nmap, netstat, tcpdump, ufw, etc.).
- To build a **portfolio** that can be shared with employers as proof of my Network Security and system administration knowledge.
